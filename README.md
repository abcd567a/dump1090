# dump1090-fa Debian/Raspbian packages

dump1090-fa is a ADS-B, Mode S, and Mode 3A/3C demodulator and decoder that
will receive and decode aircraft transponder messages received via
a directly connected software defined radio, or from data provided over a
network connection.

It is the successor to
[dump1090-mutability](https://github.com/mutability/dump1090) and is
maintained by [FlightAware](http://flightaware.com/).

It can provide a display of locally received aircraft data in a terminal or
via a browser map. Together with [PiAware](http://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware)
it can be used to contribute crowd-sourced flight tracking data to FlightAware.

It is designed to build as a Debian package, but should also be buildable on
many other Linux or Unix-like systems.

## Building under buster

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential debhelper librtlsdr-dev pkg-config dh-systemd libncurses5-dev libbladerf-dev libhackrf-dev liblimesuite-dev
$ dpkg-buildpackage -b --no-sign
```

## Building under stretch

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential debhelper librtlsdr-dev pkg-config dh-systemd libncurses5-dev libbladerf-dev
$ dpkg-buildpackage -b --no-sign
```

## Building under jessie

### Dependencies - bladeRF

You will need a build of libbladeRF. You can build packages from source:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF.git  
$ cd bladeRF  
$ git checkout 2017.12-rc1  
$ dpkg-buildpackage -b
```

Or Nuand has some build/install instructions including an Ubuntu PPA
at https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/wiki/Getting-Started:-Linux

Or FlightAware provides armhf packages as part of the piaware repository;
see https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/install

### Dependencies - rtlsdr

This is packaged with jessie. `sudo apt-get install librtlsdr-dev`

### Actually building it

Nothing special, just build it (`dpkg-buildpackage -b`)

## Building with limited dependencies

The package supports some build profiles to allow building without all
required SDR libraries being present. This will produce a package with
limited SDR support only.

Pass `--build-profiles` to `dpkg-buildpackage` with a comma-separated list of
profiles. The list of profiles should include `custom` and zero or more of
`rtlsdr`, `bladerf`, `hackrf`, `limesdr` depending on what you want:

```bash
$ dpkg-buildpackage -b --no-sign --build-profiles=custom,rtlsdr          # builds with rtlsdr support only
$ dpkg-buildpackage -b --no-sign --build-profiles=custom,rtlsdr,bladerf  # builds with rtlsdr and bladeRF support
$ dpkg-buildpackage -b --no-sign --build-profiles=custom                 # builds with _no_ SDR support (network support only)
```

## Building manually

You can probably just run "make" after installing the required dependencies.
Binaries are built in the source directory; you will need to arrange to
install them (and a method for starting them) yourself.

``make BLADERF=no`` will disable bladeRF support and remove the dependency on
libbladeRF.

``make RTLSDR=no`` will disable rtl-sdr support and remove the dependency on
librtlsdr.

``make HACKRF=no`` will disable HackRF support and remove the dependency on 
libhackrf.

``make LIMESDR=no`` will disable LimeSDR support and remove the dependency on
libLimeSuite.

## Building on OSX

Minimal testing, YMMV.

```
$ brew install librtlsdr
$ brew install libbladerf
$ brew install pkg-config
$ make
```
