  * SkyAware: Ability to show Aircraft Ident labels for all aircraft on your display (found in the View Toggles list in the settings menu)
  * SkyAware: A merged SkyAware map of 1090 and UAT aircraft for those with dual 1090/978 setups.
  * SkyAware: Direct link on the SkyAware map to go to your My ADS-B statistics page on FlightAware.com or a direct link to claim your receiver if it has not been claimed
  * SkyAware: Bold aircraft Idents are used to indicate tail numbers in the aircraft table rather than using the previous prepended underscore syntax
  * SkyAware: Default SkyAware link now at <local ip>/skyaware

  * dump1090: limesdr: use --gain value if --limesdr-gain is not specified
  * dump1090: Switch sample-conversion DSP code to use starch. Provide NEON implementations for ARM when the
    hardware supports it. Update 8-bit unsigned zero offset to reflect actual rtlsdr behavior. This gives a
    substantial speedup to sample processing for the 12/16-bit case, and a small speedup for the 8-bit case.
    Default wisdom provided for arm, aarch64, and x86; see the README for details on generating hardware-
    specific wisdom files.

  * dump1090: Attempt to correct DF11/17/18 messages where the DF field itself is damaged. This requires
    a lot more CRC checks when receiving messages off-the-air, but slightly increases the decode rate for
    DF11/17/18.
  * dump1090: Add a `--no-df-fix` option to disable the extra DF field correction, for cases where the extra
    messages are not worth the extra CPU
  * dump1090: Track recently-seen DF18 addresses, but only count them as recently-seen for DF18 decoding,
    not for Mode S / DF17

  * general: Added support for building on Buster.
  * general: Replace use of usleep with nanosleep (PR #53)

  * dump1090: When applying CRC correction to a DF11 message, assume that the interrogator
    overlay value was 0 (e.g. as in an acquisiton squitter) and use the full 24-bit syndrome
    to correct errors; do not zero out the low 7 bits of the syndrome.
  * dump1090: Changes in aircraft tracking to try to reduce the number of bogus aircraft seen
    due to noise; this replaces the crude "require 2 messages" metric used previously.
  * dump1090: Added a new statistic for "unreliable tracks", aircraft that were tracked but
    which never passed the threshold for being considered a real aircraft.
  * dump1090: Added support for per-connection verbatim mode. "--net-verbatim" now controls the
    default connection setting, and the per-connection mode can be changed by a Beast settings
    command.
  * dump1090: Replaced "--aggressive" with "--fix --fix" for 2-bit CRC correction; include
    support for this in the standard build. 2-bit corrected messages are only emitted on
    verbatim connections.
  * dump1090: Update package default options: include "--fix", increase "--net-ro-size",
    decrease "--net-ro-interval", remove a duplicated "--net-bo-port" option.
  * dump1090: Fixes to CPR decoding when multiple position sources (e.g. ADS-B and MLAT) are
    being simultaneously received (PR #55)
  * dump1090: Track ADS-B, ADS-R, and TIS-B versions independently; use the appropriate version
    when decoding version-dependent messages.

  * view1090: Display a warning in the header in interactive mode if the dump1090 connection

  * dump1090: Bail out if rtlsdr_read_async() returns early; it probably means we lost
