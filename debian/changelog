dump1090-fa (3.8.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * general: Added support for building on Buster.
  * general: Replace use of usleep with nanosleep (PR #53)

  * dump1090: When applying CRC correction to a DF11 message, assume that the interrogator
    overlay value was 0 (e.g. as in an acquisiton squitter) and use the full 24-bit syndrome
    to correct errors; do not zero out the low 7 bits of the syndrome.
  * dump1090: Changes in aircraft tracking to try to reduce the number of bogus aircraft seen
    due to noise; this replaces the crude "require 2 messages" metric used previously.
  * dump1090: Added a new statistic for "unreliable tracks", aircraft that were tracked but
    which never passed the threshold for being considered a real aircraft.
  * dump1090: Added support for per-connection verbatim mode. "--net-verbatim" now controls the
    default connection setting, and the per-connection mode can be changed by a Beast settings
    command.
  * dump1090: Replaced "--aggressive" with "--fix --fix" for 2-bit CRC correction; include
    support for this in the standard build. 2-bit corrected messages are only emitted on
    verbatim connections.
  * dump1090: Update package default options: include "--fix", increase "--net-ro-size",
    decrease "--net-ro-interval", remove a duplicated "--net-bo-port" option.
  * dump1090: Fixes to CPR decoding when multiple position sources (e.g. ADS-B and MLAT) are
    being simultaneously received (PR #55)
  * dump1090: Track ADS-B, ADS-R, and TIS-B versions independently; use the appropriate version
    when decoding version-dependent messages.

  * view1090: Include ADS-B version in interactive display
  * view1090: Display a warning in the header in interactive mode if the dump1090 connection
    has been lost
  * view1090: Request verbatim mode when connecting to dump1090
  * view1090: Exit on connection loss in --no-interactive mode

  * SkyAware: Corrected icon selection for some aircraft types
  * SkyAware: Fixed display of settings checkboxes on high-DPI displays (PR #54)
  * SkyAware: Fixes to info box display (PR #51)
  * SkyAware: Hide scroll bar when not needed (PR #22)
  * SkyAware: Update aircraft registry to 20191216

  * dump1090: Fix Rc decoding errors
  * dump1090: Compute ADS-B v0 NACp/SIL
  * dump1090: When generating aircraft.json, leave space for the final line;
    otherwise the generated json may have trailing garbage
  * dump1090: Don't update the known-address-set from DF18 messages
  * Skyview: use heading data for icon orientation if track data is unavailable
  * Skyview: don't spin forever if there's no history to load / receiver.json
    is missing
  * dump1090: Bail out if rtlsdr_read_async() returns early; it probably means we lost
    the USB device. There was a workaround for this (originally implemented
    in dump1090-mutability) that got lost in the refactoring needed to support
    different SDRs. librtlsdr can still be flaky under disconnect conditions, so
    this won't catch everything.
  * dump1090: add ENABLED to /etc/default/dump1090-fa
  * dump1090: track FMS and MCP selected altitudes separately
  * skyview: use whichever selected altitude is available
  * faup1090: updates to support PiAware 3.7.0

dump1090-fa (3.6.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Support for building on stretch

dump1090-fa (3.6.0) stable; urgency=medium

    most of the Mode S EHS data:
    BDS 1,0 (datalink capabilities); BDS 1,7 (GICB capabilities);
    BDS 2,0 (aircraft identification); BDS 3,0 (ACAS RA);
    BDS 4,0 (vertical intention); BDS 5,0 (track and turn);

dump1090-fa (3.3.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Improvements to the Mode A/C demodulator.
  * Automatically enable Mode A/C if a Beast command requesting it is received.
    (disable with --no-modeac-auto)
  * Process the radarcape position message, emit it from faup1090.
  * If view1090 is started with --modeac, request Mode A/C data from dump1090.
  * Remove the last traces of the internal webserver.
  * Updated the FlightAware aircraft data export.
  * Updated the default package-based maximum range to 360NM to match what
    piaware-support configured for sdcard installs.
  * Remove internal webserver code entirely (previously, it was just disabled
    at compile time).
  * Tweak the timing reported for Mode S and Mode A/C messages to match how
    the Beast/Radarcape does it. This affects the interval between Mode S
    and Mode A/C messages only; intervals between Mode S messages and other
    Mode S messages, or A/C and other A/C, are unchanged.

dump1090-fa (3.2.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix a stray extra comma in port 30003 output if only GNSS altitude
    was available
  * Track CPR encoding type directly rather than inferring it from airground;
    using airground meant some position messages that should be usable were
    not used
  * Mode A/C aircraft association tuning, allows dump1090 to handle much
    higher A/C rates without chewing tons of CPU
  * Map: Decrease the maximum marker size shown
  * Map: Show additional datasource information (TIS-B etc) in table mode
  * Map: Move the datablock so it doesn't overlap the zoom control
  * Map: Allow skipping the history load by adding a #nohistory fragment
    to the URL (e.g. for high latency connections)
  * view1090-fa: Use ncurses to reduce flicker on remote connections
  * view1090-fa:  Fix knots -> km/h conversion in interactive mode

    * sidebar is resizeable / hideable
    * table-only (no map) mode
    * improved FlightAware aircraft links
    * configurable units display (metric / imperial / aeronautical)

    map display) based on the publically-distributable parts of FlightAware's
    internal database
  * Try to compute a registration from ICAO address for aircraft where there
    is a predictable mapping (e.g. US N-registrations)
  * Try to coexist with other packages (e.g. dump1090-mutability) that also
    provide a lighttpd config that changes the server.stat-cache-engine setting
  * Serve actual map data on port 8080, not just a redirect
  * Redirect requests for /dump1090-fa to /dump1090-fa/ rather than 404ing.
